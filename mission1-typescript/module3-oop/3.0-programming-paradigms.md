# OOP

## What is Paradigm?
Style used to write and organize code.

### Programming Paradigms:

### Procedural Programming
A coding approach that organizes a computer program into a set of structured procedures or functions. THere procedures consist of a series of well-defined steps or instructions that are executed sequentially.

### Functional Programming
Functional programming is like using a set of building blocks that are like mathematical functions. This helps in making our code easier to understand and less likely to have bugs.

### Declarative Programming
Declarative programming is an approach to writhing computer programs that focuses on describing the desired outcome or result, rather then explicitly specifying the step-by-step instructions to achieve that outcome. In declarative programming, you define what you want to accomplish, and the underlying system or framework figures out how to achieve.

### Object Oriented Programming
Object-Oriented programming is a programming that organizes code around object, which are instances of classes defining data and behavior.

### Event-Driven Programming
This paradigm revolves around responding to events or signals generated by the system or user interactions.
